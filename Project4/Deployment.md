# Deployment

I had some issues uploading the project to the website normally, so I looked up some other ways to do it online and I ended up using a command terminal to upload my working site.

I created a package.json file and used npm commands to download the neccessary packages for my project. I then edited my restAPI_dev.js file to listen to port 3000 locally and export to Vercel.
I then added a vercel.json file to handle my static HTML file. Finally, I deployed the Vercel server using the terminal and got a working webpage.
