# Project 4

The file within the folder /Project4 have been cloned from a private GitHub repository onto the Vercel server.

An Express server has been installed and a package.json lists which packages are needed.

A 'npm install' was used in the terminal to add packages from a file 'node_modules'.

Node.js was used to host the server locally.
